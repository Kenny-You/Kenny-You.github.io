                This is the GIF of my working circuit. So immaculate.

                Here is a picture of my circuit. I chose to use 220 ohm resistors for all three LEDs, because the exact calculated resistance was not available. 220 ohms allowed the LEDs to function without breaking as well.

                Here is my code snippet. All important lines of code are commented. The chosen values for delay were random and have no meaning. 1000ms delay was too slow in my opinion.

                This is the schematic that I drew up. All of my calculations are presented as well as color coded for varying LEDs that I used.
